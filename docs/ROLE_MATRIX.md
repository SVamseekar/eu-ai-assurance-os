# Role authorization matrix

Source of truth for RBAC enforcement via `TenantAuthorizationService.requireAnyRole(...)` on API mutators and sensitive reads. Aligns with `docs/SECURITY.md` roles (enum: `UserRole`).

**Legend:** ✓ allowed · — denied · stage = workflow stage `requiredRole` (Admin may act on any stage)

## Notes

- **Authentication** is orthogonal: every path except the unauthenticated allowlist requires a valid `Authorization: Bearer` JWT or `X-Api-Key`. Tenant/actor always come from the credential, never from client-supplied `X-Tenant-Id` / `X-Actor-Id`.
- **Tenant isolation** still applies after role checks: repositories filter by `tenantId` from `TenantContext`. Cross-tenant IDs return **404** (not 200 with foreign data).
- **AUDITOR** is intentionally read-mostly: no registry writes, control edits, evidence ingest, contract mutations, eval write ops, or manual audit append.
- **Workflow stages** encode required role at open time (`ApprovalWorkflowService`); Admin may approve/reject/override any stage.
- **Eval callbacks** require both an authorized Admin/AI Engineering actor **and** a valid HMAC signature (`X-Eval-Timestamp` + `X-Eval-Signature`).

## Enforcement map

| Area | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| `AiSystemController` mutators + evidence pack | `TenantAuthorizationService` |
| `ControlController` PUT system control | `TenantAuthorizationService` |
| `EvidenceController` document create/upload | `TenantAuthorizationService` |
| `DataContractController` mutators | `TenantAuthorizationService` |
| `EvalDatasetController` POST | `TenantAuthorizationService` |
| `EvalRunController` create + privileged ops | `TenantAuthorizationService` |
| `AuditController` POST | `TenantAuthorizationService` |
| `ApprovalWorkflowService` stage actions | role + Admin override rules |

When adding a new mutator, extend this matrix and add a FORBIDDEN regression test (typically as `AUDITOR`).
