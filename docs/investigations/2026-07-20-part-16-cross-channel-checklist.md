## Per-asset apply status (session 2026-07-20)

| Asset | Original file modified? | MD proposal filed? |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| CV DOCX/PDF | **No** (restored / left original) | Yes — `…-cv-proposed-changes.md` |
| Pitch PDF | **No** | Yes — `…-pitch-proposed-changes.md` |
| Portfolio `projects.ts` | **No** (any trial edit reverted) | Yes — `…-portfolio-proposed-changes.md` |
| Markdown CVs under Projects/ | **No** | Optional paste in CV MD |
| Product application code | **No** | N/A |

---

## Residual (program)

1. **OAuth production smoke** not signed off — public wording must stay “implemented; prod smoke pending.”
2. **NFR p95 / 99.9%** are targets, not production-certified SLOs.
3. **Sector connectors** are stubs/SPI only.
4. **Reg monitor** assistive / polled; not live proprietary legal scrapers.
5. Channel binaries (CV / pitch / portfolio) remain **owner-applied** after reviewing these MD files.

---

## Recommended apply order

1. Portfolio `projects.ts` (code, easy review / PR)  
2. Pitch dated PDF (keep old file)  
3. CV via **Save As** dated copy first, then optional replace of live DOCX  
4. Re-check this checklist and file a short signoff when live surfaces match

*Checklist only. No original channel binaries modified by documentation packet.*
