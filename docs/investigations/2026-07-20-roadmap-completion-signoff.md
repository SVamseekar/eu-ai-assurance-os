# Roadmap completion signoff (Parts 0–15; Part 11 docs)

**Date:** 2026-07-20  
**Branch context:** Part 11 docs alignment on tip of `origin/main` (metrics freeze Part 2 / tip at freeze `c0d5cd4`; later main includes Part 2 index).  
**Metrics authority:** `docs/METRICS_CANONICAL.md` — do not re-measure unless obvious drift.  
**Rule:** No fake certifications, legal finality, customer counts, or “production SSO verified” without smoke signoff.

## Live URLs checked

| URL | Expectation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| https://euassuranceai.souravamseekar.com | Landing + dashboard shell | Live (Part 3 verified in metrics freeze) |
| https://github.com/SVamseekar/eu-ai-assurance-os | Public repo | Live |

API production host may be separate from the Vercel dashboard origin; treat Compose/local H2 as the reproducible CI path.

## Platform facts (cite only)

From `docs/METRICS_CANONICAL.md` (measured 2026-07-20, freeze tip `c0d5cd4`):

- ~64 REST mappings · 190 automated tests · Flyway V1–V16 (+ postgres V4)
- Next.js 16 · Spring Boot 3.3 · Java 17
- Hash-chained audit · HMAC eval callbacks · Evidence Pack JSON+PDF
- 3 sector packs + SPI · assisted determination · certification readiness · reg monitor

## Known residual risks

1. **OAuth production smoke** not signed off — public wording: “implemented; prod smoke pending.”
2. **NFR p95 / 99.9%** are targets, not production-certified SLOs.
3. **Sector connectors** are stubs; no live vendor OAuth apps.
4. **Reg monitor** remote sources disabled by default; curated bootstrap is assistive only.
5. **Part 5** minor controls UI polish may remain; API/catalog shipped.
6. **Part 16** channel binaries (CV/pitch/portfolio) not in this signoff.

---

## Release tag recommendation

- Prefer **`v0.9.0`** until OAuth production smoke is executed and recorded.
- Move to **`v1.0.0`** after smoke signoff + Part 11 merge + optional Part 16 channel refresh.

## Signoff statement

Phases 0–7 product scope described in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and PRD §4–§6 are **landed on main** with honest assisted/readiness naming. Documentation after Part 11 matches code. No claim of legal certification, notified-body status, or official conformity assessment.

*Filed for Part 11 — Documentation alignment.*
